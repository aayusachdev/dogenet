Using firebase client is more bulky in size as compared to firebase serverless

2 Folders structure

Pages for different routes based screens.
Components for different components.

All folder names should be in smallcase.
Only components name should be in PascalCase/TitleCase and nothing else.
If a component has multiple files like styles for it, we use same name as folder and put an
index.js inside of it, but all code goes in the component file itself.

.js extension for all files and not .jsx (Anti airbnb)

Components inside Pages which will only be used with Routes can be in lowercase.
other React component need to be PascalCase ONLY.

import { Appbar, ToolBar } from '@material-ui/core'
The problem with this approach is each time we plan to import one component it is importing the
entire library.

import { Appbar } from '@material-ui/core/AppBar'
This is more efficient and helps in Tree-Shaking.

import {Link} from 'react-router-dom/Link'
    instead of
import {Link} from 'react-router-dom' -> For implementing Tree-Shaking.
